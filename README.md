# DevOps Portfolio

A ready-to-upload GitHub repo structure for a DevOps/Cloud portfolio using React + Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Since this project was generated in an environment without Node.js, you will need to install Node.js on your machine to run it.

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production**:

   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains all React components (Hero, About, Projects, etc.).
- `src/assets`: Contains images. You can replace them with your own.

## Customization
